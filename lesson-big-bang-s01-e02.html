                        <span>Oh no, let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.</span>

The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning.

                        <span>Hey guys, I got this.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="name-highlight">Sheldon: </span> 
                        <span>Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?</span>
                    </p>

                        <span>Also inefficient, and might be loud.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span>How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC...</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="name-highlight">Penny: </span> 
                        <span>Guys, this is actually really simple.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="name-highlight">Howard: </span> 
                        <span>Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="name-highlight">Leonard: </span> 
                        <span>Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?</span>

                        <span>And if water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.</span>

                        <span>Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="name-highlight">Leonard: </span> 
                        <span>Oh, I've got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminum.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <span>Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="name-highlight">Howard: </span> 
                        <span>Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square meters of scrap aluminum, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="name-highlight">Leonard: </span> 
                        <span>Meet back here in an hour?</span>

                        <span>Done.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span class="name-highlight">Leonard: </span> 
                        <span>Got it. (They all leave).</span>
