                        <span>Oh no, let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.</span>

                        <span>And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.</span>
